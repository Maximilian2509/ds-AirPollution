    "##### 2. Ozone (O3) concentrations\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "In the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous solar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient cleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the health of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important greenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change. Since the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1980s and the subsequent Montreal Protocol regulating the production of chlorine-containing ozone-depleting substances, ozone has been routinely monitored from the ground and from space.\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric trace gas for understanding tropospheric chemistry. In certain urban areas, it is a major atmospheric pollutant. Main sources of CO are combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and atmospheric oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. Whereas fossil fuel combustion is the main source of CO at northern mid-latitudes, the oxidation of isoprene and biomass burning play an important role in the tropics. \n",

    "##### 4. Formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Formaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), leading eventually to CO2. Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) are, together with NOx, CO and CH4, among the most important precursors of tropospheric O3. The major HCHO source in the remote atmosphere is CH4 oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs emitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important and localized enhancements of the HCHO levels. The seasonal and inter-annual variations of the formaldehyde distribution are principally related to temperature changes and fire events, but also to changes in anthropogenic activities. HCHO concentrations in the boundary layer can be directly related to the release of short-lived hydrocarbons, which mostly cannot be observed directly from space. \n",

    "When the AAI is positive, it indicates the presence of UV-absorbing aerosols like dust and smoke. It is useful for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning. The wavelengths used have very low ozone absorption, so unlike aerosol optical thickness measurements, AAI can be calculated in the presence of clouds. Daily global coverage is therefore possible.\n",

It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global scale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate. Only about 30% of the emitted SO2 comes from natural sources; the majority is of anthropogenic origin. SO2 emissions adversely affect human health and air quality.

    "Methane (CH4) is, after carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important contributor to the anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse effect. Roughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such, it is important to continue the record of satellite based measurements. TROPOMI aims at providing CH4 column concentrations with high sensitivity to the Earth's surface, good spatiotemporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse modeling of sources and sinks.\n",
